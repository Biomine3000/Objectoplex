* Objectoplex, an Object System Distribution written in Python
** Environment setup
   You need gevent *only* for running the server.  All clients are usable with
   Python 2.6 except for service_client, which requires Python 2.7.

   - =virtualenv env=
   - =source env/bin/activate=
   - =pip install -r requirements.txt=
  gevent might not install on your system, get it via their public repo then:
  =hg clone https://bitbucket.org/denis/gevent= and run
  =python setup.py install= (you might need to install *cython* to get the
  extension to build).
